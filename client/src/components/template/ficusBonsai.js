    <h2>Choosing the Right Pot</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to choosing a pot for your Ficus bonsai, you'll want to select one that is appropriate for the size of your plant. A good rule of thumb is to choose a pot that is about 2/3 the size of your plant's root ball. This will give your plant enough room to grow while still keeping it contained.

    <p>
        You'll also want to make sure that the pot has adequate drainage holes to prevent water from pooling at the bottom, which can lead to root rot.

    <p>The plant is a good choice for low-light conditions and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, making it ideal for beginners.</p>
      
    <h3>Care Requirements:</h3>
    <p>
        Here are a few tips for caring for your Ficus Bonsai

      />
    </div>
  
    <h3>Soil and Fertilizer:</h3>
    <p>
        Ficus bonsai prefers well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. A good potting mix for Ficus bonsai should contain a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to fertilizing, you can use a balanced fertilizer every two weeks during the growing season (spring and summer), and once a month during the dormant season (fall and winter).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Watering:</h3>
    <p>Ficus bonsai likes to be kept consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Water your plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. It's important to avoid letting the soil dry out completely, as this can cause your plant to drop its leaves.</p>
    
    <h3>Light and Temperature: </h3>
    <p>Ficus bonsai prefers bright, indirect light, but can tolerate lower light conditions as well. Avoid placing your plant in direct sunlight, as this can scorch the leaves.</p>
    <p>Ficus bonsai also prefers warm temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C). Avoid placing your plant in drafty areas or near cold windows, as this can cause stress and lead to leaf drop.</p>

    <h3>Pruning and Shaping</h3>
    <p>Pruning and shaping your Ficus bonsai is essential for maintaining its shape and promoting healthy growth. You'll want to prune your plant regularly to remove any dead or diseased branches, as well as any branches that are growing in the wrong direction.</p>
    <p>To shape your Ficus bonsai, use wire to gently bend and shape the branches into the desired form. Just be sure to remove the wire before it starts to cut into the bark.</p>
