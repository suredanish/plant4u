    <h3>Watering:</h3>
    <p>
        The plant prefers moist soil, but it's important to avoid overwatering. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again. Be sure to use well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Light:</h3>
    <p>The plant can tolerate low light conditions, but it will grow faster and be more vibrant if it receives bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight, as this can scorch the leaves.</p>
    
    <h3>Humidity: </h3>
    <p>Golden Pothos can tolerate average humidity levels, but it will benefit from occasional misting or a humidifier to maintain healthy foliage.</p>
  
    <h3>Fertiliser</h3>
    <p>Feed the plant with a balanced fertiliser every 2-3 months during the growing season (spring and summer). Be sure to follow the instructions on the fertiliser package to avoid over-fertilizing.</p>
    
    <h2>Propagation</h2>
    <p> Golden Pothos is an easy plant to propagate, and it can be done in a few different ways: </p>

    <h3>Stem cuttings:</h3>
    <p>Take a stem cutting that is about 4-6 inches long, making sure it has at least one leaf. Place the cutting in a jar of water and wait for roots to form before planting in soil.</p>

    <h3>Division:</h3>
    <p>When the plant outgrows its container, you can divide it into two or more plants. Simply gently separate the root ball and repot in fresh soil.</p>

    <h2>Pest and Disease Control</h2>
